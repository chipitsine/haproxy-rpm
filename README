Package %{?scl_name} provides HAProxy load balancer delivered as a
Software Collection (SCL). For more information about Software
Collections, see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{?scl_name}
collection, you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a
working HAProxy load balancer.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 || 0%{?fedora} >= 15
Usage: systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}haproxy
%else
Usage: service %{?scl_prefix}haproxy start
%endif

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications which
are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy, but are stored in an
alternative location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the
%{?scl_name} collection.

HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high
availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based
applications.

When you want to work with the %{?scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment. The only exception is starting and stopping
%{?scl_prefix}haproxy daemon, where SCL environment is enabled
implicitely within the SysV init script or systemd unit file.

Configuration for the %{?scl_name} software collection is located
under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{?scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{?scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{?scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{?scl_name} software collection enabled.

%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 || 0%{?fedora} >= 15
systemctl start %{?scl_prefix}haproxy
%else
service %{?scl_prefix}haproxy start
%endif
    Starts the HAProxy service from %{?scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{?scl_name} 'man haproxy'
  Show man pages for the haproxy command, which is a part of the
  %{?scl_name} software collection.

Files:
%{_scl_scripts}/service-environment
Define which software collections should be enabled for the daemon process.
